            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Poorvi.
                I'm a proud mom of two wonderful daughters‚Äîmy older one is 11 and the younger is 7. I've been working in
                an accounting firm for over 10 years.
                This year, I have challenged myself to learn coding! I know it can be tricky and difficult at times, but
                I am determined and excited to take it on.
                I love dancing, Bollywood music, and cooking. One of my Favorite simple joys is enjoying a warm cup of
                ginger tea in the morning, especially on rainy days. ‚òîüçµ
